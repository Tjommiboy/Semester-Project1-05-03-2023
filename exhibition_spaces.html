                        of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory
                        of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

                        didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                        Over a series of exhibits we explore the
                        history of medicine and take a look at
